Hayes  Seconder   - Councillor P. Mick  Whereas 5 traffic studies with engineering reports have been prepared in the past 10 years;  Whereas these studies have concluded that additional traffic control is not warranted at the Pine/Pleasant intersection;  Whereas the sheer number of studies conducted indicates that this intersection is of major concern to the residents of Ward 3 in general and the P-Patch in specific, regardless of studies that suggest traffic control is not warranted;  Whereas a petition with 47 names have been submitted (attached) that once again supports the request for a three way stop;  Whereas   numerous   complaints   have   come   to   the   Councillors   of   Ward   3 requesting a three way stop at the Pine/Pleasant intersection;  Whereas   St.   Paul’s   School   with   one   of   the   highest   elementary   school attendance   records   in   the   City   has   relocated   its   school   bus   loading   zone adjacent to the Pine/Pleasant intersection creating additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic at this intersection;  Whereas this intersection is also a school crossing zone, a 3 way stop of which arguably will add protection for the children attending St. Paul's School and ease the apprehension of the school crossing guard;  Whereas the stop lights installed at McNabb and Pentagon have not served the purpose of diverting traffic from the Pine/Pleasant intersection as per their original intent; 7.

Rowswell:  Whereas Christmas is a special time of year for families; and  Whereas the City of Sault Ste.

Caicco  Seconder   Councillor S. Butland  Whereas several requests have been made of the Provincial Government by the City of Sault Ste. Marie and other charity casino venues to have the Province increase the municipal share of slot revenues from 5% to 8%; and  Whereas these requests have been made so that the extra 3% can be entirely used to help offset the negative financial impact that charitable organizations and non-profit groups have felt in charity casino venues since the casinos have opened as people redirect their disposable entertainment dollars; and  Whereas the Trillium Foundation originally had been set up by the Province to assist such groups but in fact does not effectively replace the lost revenue caused by the casino openings; and  Whereas instead of increasing the amount of money which is given to the Trillium Foundation commensurate with profits that the Province enjoys from casinos, it has actually reduced such amount, making it even more difficult for charities and non-profit groups to survive; and 7.   (e)   Whereas   the   value   to   any   community   of   healthy   charitable   and   non-profit organizations cannot be overstated in the good that is done for the community;  Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Sault Ste. Marie host a meeting (forum, symposium) on the effects that charity casinos have had on charitable and non-profit organizations in those communities where they operate as well as to determine if and to what extent, the Trillium Foundation has effectively provided assistance to those groups and whether or not increased funding for the Trillium Foundation or increasing the 5% share to 8% for municipalities might deal with the serious state of such organizations in charity casino venues; and  Further be it resolved that in addition to representation of municipal government and major charities from charity casino communities, the Provincial Minister of Economic Development and Trade, the Honourable Joe Cordiano, and the Minister of Consumer and Business Services, the Honourable Jim Watson, M.P.P.’s of said communities and officials from AGCO be invited to attend.

CARRIED.  Moved by   Councillor J. Caicco  Seconded by   Councillor S. Butland  Whereas several requests have been made of the Provincial Government by the City of Sault Ste. Marie and other charity casino venues to have the Province increase the municipal share of slot revenues from 5% to 8%; and  Whereas these requests have been made so that the extra 3% can be entirely used to help offset the negative financial impact that charitable organizations and non-profit groups have felt in charity casino venues since the casinos have opened as people redirect their disposable entertainment dollars; and  Whereas the Trillium Foundation originally had been set up by the Province to assist such groups but in fact does not effectively replace the lost revenue caused by the casino openings; and  Whereas instead of increasing the amount of money which is given to the Trillium Foundation commensurate with profits that the Province enjoys from casinos, it has actually reduced such amount, making it even more difficult for charities and non-profit groups to survive; and  Whereas   the   value   to   any   community   of   healthy   charitable   and   non-profit organizations cannot be overstated in the good that is done for the community; 7.   (a)   Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Sault Ste. Marie host a meeting (forum, symposium) on the effects that charity casinos have had on charitable and non-profit organizations in those communities where they operate as well as to determine if and to what extent, the Trillium Foundation has effectively provided assistance to those groups and whether or not increased funding for the Trillium Foundation or increasing the 5% share to 8% for municipalities might deal with the serious state of such organizations in charity casino venues; and  Further be it resolved that in addition to representation of municipal government and major charities from charity casino communities, the Provincial Minister of Economic Development and Trade, the Honourable Joe Cordiano, and the Minister of Consumer and Business Services, the Honourable Jim Watson, the Minister of Culture and Robert Hann and Associates Ltd., M.P.P.’s of said communities and officials from AGCO be invited to attend.

(c)   Whereas there are many senior citizens who cannot even try to remove this ridge of frozen hardpack snow and slush; and  Whereas this has caused a lot of hardship on constituents and seniors these recent years;  Now therefore be it resolved that City Council recommend and authorize the Works Centre that when they send the graders out to cut down the streets of hardpack snow and slush thus creating a ridge at everyone’s driveway that a payloader or a 4 x 4 truck that has snowplows follow the grader to remove the ridge of hardpack snow and slush before the ridge of snow and slush freezes. OFFICIALLY READ NOT DEALT WITH. TABLED TO NOVEMBER 15, 2004.  (d)   Moved by   Councillor N. DelBianco  Seconded by   Councillor L. Turco  Whereas the Sault Trails Advocacy Committee (STAC) promotes alternatives to private motorized transportation; and  Whereas the city will face a lack of parking in the downtown area during the construction of the Multi-Use Event Centre, which may take between 12 to 18 months; and  Whereas STAC recognizes that the City is investigating ways to solve this problem and may be contemplating the purchasing of additional property for parking lot developments; and  Whereas STAC has passed a resolution asking the City to supply free transit passes during events such as, but not limiting to, the Greyhound games at the Memorial Gardens, using the entrance ticket for the day of the game as a transit pass which may alleviate some of their concerns; and  Whereas STAC realizes that some benefits of this initiative may include positive impacts on parking, reduced vehicular congestion in the area surrounding the Memorial Gardens, lower vehicular pollution and increased awareness of the city’s public transit system;  Therefore be it resolved that the City of Sault Ste. Marie investigate this concept as a pilot project during the construction of the Multi-Use Event Centre and report back to Council with their recommendations. CARRIED.  (e)   Moved by   Councillor F.
